Hello everyone.  
I'm starting a new series about Laravel 5 and Docker and this is the first post.  
In the end of the serie we will deploy a Laravel 5 API on production using Docker containers.  

First things first, the concepts:  
Docker is about containers, container is a "Virtual Machine" that run a single process.  
The main difference between a Docker container and a regular Virtual Machine is that the container use the host machine resources.  
So, with few resources you can build great applications.  

You can have more information about Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/).  

> By the way, there is a very cool walkthrough, that teach you the command basics. [Docker Tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/)

Let's get started.
