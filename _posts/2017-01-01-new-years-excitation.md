Happy new years everybody, about that, i have something to talk.  

I started to think about the whole `new years` thing and i came to a conclusion `how stupid is this thing`.  
It's not the party or the fireworks, i like this part, it's the `new year` "resolutions".  
That idea doesn't make any sense.  
What happened to make people think that their plans it's gonna work this time?  
Really, nothing is happened, to tell the true, gravity worked as expected, earth gave a spin around the sun.  

My goals is: learn english and get out of Brazil.  
When that desire came to me, i just started to work on it.  
This is what i want, i have no time to wait for the `new years` i and think everybody should make the same.  
Don't think that the `new years` excitation will give you strength to make you reach your goals.  
If you want something, just make some plans and you are good to go.  
Again, happy `new years` everybody!
