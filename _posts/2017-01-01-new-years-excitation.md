<!-- Testing -->
Happy new year everybody!  
About that, I have something to say.  

I started to think about the whole new year's thing and I came to a conclusion: `how stupid is that`.  
It’s not the party or the fireworks, I like that. It’s the new year's “resolutions”.  
That idea doesn’t make any sense.  
What makes people think that their plans are going to work out this time?  
Really, nothing has happened, gravity worked as expected and the earth just gave another spin around the sun.  

Take me for example, my goals are to learn english and get out of Brazil.  
At the moment I decided those things, I started working on them.  
This is what I want, I have no time to wait for the new year and I think everybody should do the same.  
Don’t think that the new year's excitation will give you the strength to make you reach your goals.  
If you want something, just stop making fool of yourself and you are good to go.  
Again, happy new year everybody!
